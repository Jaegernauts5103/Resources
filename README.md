# Resources
This is a file that should include all the resources our programmers would need.
Organized by programming language, type of resource, whose it's for, etc.

This repository is for anyone, owner or contributor, who needs any resources.

## Adding to this Repository
**Only Owners should add to this repository!**

If you find a good resource, please send it to an owner and they can add it to
the repository.

## For the First Year:
Resources may be limited! For the first year of Jaegernauts5103's organization,
there will be a "Resource dump" folder, where **anyone can contribute**. If you
find anything that you think robotics needs now or in the future, please go ahead
and add the like somewhere

## Organizing Links
Links will be stored in .md (markdown) files. This way, you can write the name
of the link and add a hypertext link, 
[like this](https://github.com/Jaegernauts5103/Resources).

To create a link like that, type it in this format:

\[title](link)

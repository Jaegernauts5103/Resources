# Resources
This is a file that should include all the resources our programmers would need.
Organized by programming language, type of resource, whose it's for, etc.

This repository is for anyone, owner or contributor, who needs any resources.
Don't be embarrased to use anything here!

## For the First Year:
Resources may be limited! For the first year of Jaegernauts5103's organization 
(2020-2021 school year), there will be a "Resource dump" folder, where **anyone 
can contribute**. If you find anything that you think robotics needs now or in 
the future, please go ahead and add the link in the **correct folder**! Links
do not have to be organized, just make sure the links work. The owners will
go through and organize everything later, so don't worry about it. Further
instructions are in the "Resource dump" folder.

## Adding to this Repository (Not enforced until 2021-2022 school year)
**Only Owners should add to this repository!**

If you find a good resource, please send it to an owner and they can add it to
the repository.

## Organizing Links
Links will be stored in .md (markdown) files. This way, you can write the name
of the link and add a hypertext link, 
[like this](https://github.com/Jaegernauts5103/Resources).

To create a link like that, type it in this format:

\[title](link)

> `smack-my-*****-up.sh` - sends a text message "late at

>The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server

> `kumar-***hole.sh` - scans the inbox for emails from "Kumar" 
> (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like "help", 
> "trouble", "sorry" etc. If keywords are found - the script 
> SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging 
> database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply "no 
> worries mate, be careful next time".

> `hangover.sh` - another cron-job that is set to specific 
> dates. Sends automated emails like "not feeling well/gonna 
> work from home" etc. Adds a random "reason" from another 
> predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no 
> interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.

> (and the oscar goes to) `****ing-coffee.sh` - this one 
> waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session 
> to our coffee-machine (we had no ****ing idea the coffee 
> machine is on the network, runs linux, and has a TCP socket 
> up and running) and sends something like `sys brew`. Turns 
> out this thing starts brewing a mid-sized half-caf latte and 
> waits another 24 (!) seconds before pouring it into a cup. 
> The timing is exactly how long it takes to walk to the 
> machine from the dudes desk.

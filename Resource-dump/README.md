# Resource dump!
This resource dump will be open for this organization's first year (2020-2021 school year).
**Anybody can contribute!** And please do so!

The point of this file is not to be organized, but it is to find resources for us to use.
You can organize your files in markdown, Paste a link into the main file, or upload your own
file full of links. Whatever you choose, it will be scrubbed and organized later.

## Remember!
Whatever you put here will be forever connected to your account, this isn't really a place to
joke around!
